        Hello, my name is Torfi √Åsgeirsson and I make games.
        <br><br>
        I have been making games and apps for over 10 years. I have also taught game development, organized games events, and run game development communities.
        <br><br>
        If you'd like to contact me or keep up with what I'm doing, I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/torfias">@torfias</a> on twitter.
        <br><br>
        I release most of my games on <a href="https://torfi.itch.io/">torfi.itch.io</a>
        <br><br>
        Here are some of the things I've worked on:
    </p>
    {%- if site.posts.size > 0 -%}
    <div class="portfolio-flex-grid">
        <div class="portfolio-flex-row">
            {%- for post in site.posts -%}
                <div class="portfolio-flex-item portfolio-item">
                    <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | relative_url }}"><img src="img/posts/{{ post.img }}" class="img-responsive" alt="{{ post.alt }}" ></a>
                </div>
            {%- endfor -%}
        </div>
    </div>
    {%- endif -%}

</div>

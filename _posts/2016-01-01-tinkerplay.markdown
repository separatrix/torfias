Tinkerplay (originally known as Modio) is a 3D printing app made for iPad. I was the first programmer hired and helped with some of the design problems as well.

After releasing it in 2015, it was acquired along with the company by Autodesk that same year.

Unfortunately, the app is no longer available but you can see a short video of it in action [here](https://youtu.be/wldGtKUoutY).
